# üöÄ AI Development Assistant Bundle - Roadmap

## Current Status: v1.1.0 - Enhanced Architecture Release

Hey developers! üëã We've been working hard to make this bundle not just functional, but truly production-ready. Here's where we're heading and what we've accomplished.

---

## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (v1.1.0)

### 1. **Advanced Dependency Injection with Compiler Passes** 
**What we built:** Smart auto-discovery system for analyzers and AI providers
**Why it matters:** You can now create custom analyzers just by implementing the interface and tagging them. No more manual service registration!
**Developer impact:** 
- Add new analyzers without touching configuration
- Providers are automatically ordered by priority
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
**What we built:** Comprehensive event system for analysis lifecycle
**Why it matters:** Perfect extensibility without modifying core code
**Events available:**
- `PreAnalysisEvent` - Modify requests before analysis
- `PostAnalysisEvent` - Process results after analysis  
- `AIProviderFailureEvent` - Handle provider errors gracefully
**Developer impact:** Build plugins, custom logging, result transformation

### 3. **Type-Safe Data Transfer Objects**
**What we built:** Immutable DTOs for requests and results
**Why it matters:** Better IDE support, fewer bugs, cleaner APIs
**What you get:**
- `AnalysisRequest` - Type-safe analysis parameters
- `AnalysisResult` - Structured, searchable results
- Fluent builder patterns for easy usage

### 4. **Professional Exception Hierarchy**
**What we built:** Specific exception types with rich context
**Why it matters:** Better error handling and debugging
**Exception types:**
- `AIProviderException` - Provider-specific errors with retry logic
- `AnalysisException` - Analysis failures with context
- `ConfigurationException` - Configuration validation errors

## üéØ Next Phase: Production Excellence (v1.2.0)

### 5. **Bundle Health Monitoring** üè•
**What we're building:** Comprehensive health check system
**Timeline:** Next 2 weeks
**Features:**
- Real-time provider availability checking
- Configuration validation with helpful suggestions
- Performance metrics and bottleneck detection
- Integration status dashboard

**Developer benefits:**
- `php bin/console ai-dev-assistant:health` - One command to check everything
- Proactive issue detection before they affect analysis
- Clear troubleshooting guidance

### 6. **Smart Caching & Performance** ‚ö°
**What we're building:** Multi-layer caching with intelligent invalidation
**Timeline:** Next 3 weeks
**Features:**
- Redis/Memcached support for distributed setups
- Semantic caching (similar code analysis reuse)
- Background cache warming
- Cache hit/miss analytics

**Developer benefits:**
- 10x faster analysis on similar codebases
- Reduced AI API costs through smart caching
- Production-ready scaling capabilities

### 7. **Developer Experience Enhancements** üõ†Ô∏è
**What we're building:** Tools that make your life easier
**Timeline:** Next 4 weeks
**Features:**
- Symfony WebProfiler integration panel
- VS Code extension for real-time analysis
- GitHub Actions integration templates
- Detailed analysis reports with charts

**Developer benefits:**
- Debug analysis directly in Symfony toolbar
- Get feedback while coding
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Beautiful, shareable reports

## üîÆ Future Vision (v2.0.0)

### 8. **AI Model Training & Customization**
**The big idea:** Train models on your specific codebase patterns
**What this enables:**
- Custom rule sets for your team's coding standards
- Framework-specific analysis (Laravel, Symfony, etc.)
- Legacy code modernization suggestions
- Architectural pattern detection

### 9. **Team Collaboration Features**
**The big idea:** Analysis results as a team resource
**What this enables:**
- Shared analysis database across team
- Code review assistance with AI insights
- Team coding standard enforcement
- Historical code quality tracking

### 10. **Enterprise Integration**
**The big idea:** Enterprise-grade deployment and management
**What this enables:**
- LDAP/SSO authentication
- Multi-tenant analysis isolation
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- SLA monitoring and alerting
